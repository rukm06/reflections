When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
	
	When I am not working on personal computer or on a git non-installed computer, I may prefer to use remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There might be also some modifications in local repository. If these modifications haven't push to remote repository, auto up-to-date might take unexpected action to local repository(e.g. merge).  

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks means to make a copied repository from github to github.
    Clones means to make a copied repository from github to local directory, or from local to local.
    Branches means to create a new extended codebase at certain commit point to separate a new codebase from master.

    I will use fork when I'd like to copy a repository from somebody's github to my github. And, using clone when I need to remote copy a repository to local. Finally, I'd like to create branch when I want to take experiment, but do not influence master codebase.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    First, we can work at local directory without internet access for a while.(e.g. get on a plane)
    Second, having a copy of last known state of remote is just like a buffer between local and remote repository. If out of sync occurs between local and remote repository, we can check the difference first and decide how to merge.

and what would be harder?

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
